## The election summary
This script can be used with any voting data for any election.  Currently there were only three counties being compared.  Depending on the number of counties and the different ways to look at the data, we could modify it to possibly look at demographics, or mayeb Denver won because it just had that many more poeple to votes and the other counties just had a smaller population.  Depending on the data collected of the voters, times of the votes being cast, total population in each county, we could look at keeping polls open longer into the day or earlier in the morning, how many of the people in each county actually voted, if we got collected data about gender, even how many men versus women voted so the candidates could even know who they could work on speaking with during their next campaign to boost votes.
